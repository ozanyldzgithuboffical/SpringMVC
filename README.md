## Request Mapping
- Request mapping is used to handle request urls to resolve the correct method in business controller.
- You can use method level,class level or global level request mapping
- In method level request mapping,the url will be special for the method.
- In class level request mapping, in addition to method level request,all requests for the controller are grouped.
- In global level request mapping,every method is reached via same url.
