## Custom Error Pages
- Any error generated within an app is associated with a HTTP error code. For example, suppose that a user enters a URL /invalidUrl into the browser, but no such RequestMapping has been defined inside of Spring. Then, a HTTP code of 404 generated by the underlying web server. The lines that we have just added to our web.xml tells Spring to execute the logic written in the method that is mapped to the URL /errors.

- The corresponding Java Servlet configuration doesn't unfortunately have an API for setting the error page â€“ so in this case, we actually need the web.xml.
